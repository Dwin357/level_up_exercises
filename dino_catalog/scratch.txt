  X - adjust names (turtle:snake)
work on matching of root words in header titles
  X - implement "carnivore" search
  X - implement "big" search

refactor controller so that it holds the options list
***I dislike this b/c it puts "view elements" in controller, maybe having some kind of object that is handed to the display

Consider making dino objects rather than hashs

Figure out how to export the info as json

snake_case:  symbols, methods, variables
SCREAMING_SNAKE: constants
CamelCase: classes, modules

new structure idea:
-dino object
  *key attributes
    name, weight, diet, locomotion, period
  *catch all "other" attribute
    stores a hash w/ non-standard info
      (continent, description, unforseen)

-dino catalouge
  *stores collection of dino obj
  *has spc search methods
  *has load csv method

-dino command line interface
  *wraps the catalouge and
